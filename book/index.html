<h1>3D Graphics with SceneKit</h1>

<p>This is the website for the upcoming book, 3D Graphics with SceneKit. It is a book about Apple&#8217;s 3D rendering framework for Mac OS X.</p>


<h3>Current table of contents:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Starting out</strong> – From setting up a project to getting a 3D scene on screen.</li>
<li><strong>Why things look the way they do</strong> – Covers how lights and materials cause geometry to look shaded.</li>
<li><strong>More of a Scene</strong> – How to use the node hierarchy to create a scene with more geometry, text and animations.</li>
<li><strong>Adding detail with images</strong> – Using textures, how they work and the effects they can bring.</li>
<li><strong>From a point of view</strong> – Cameras, looking around in a scene, zooming in on objects.</li>
<li><strong>Special effects</strong> – A chapter dedicated to effects.</li>
<li><strong>Generating geometry</strong> – How to generate geometry data to use in SceneKit.</li>
<li><strong>Morphing</strong> – Setup and morph geometries between multiple targets.</li>
<li><strong>Skinning</strong> – Bend and move 3D models rigged to skeletons.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> – How to find and solve common performance problems.</li>
<li><strong>The rendering pipeline</strong> – An overview of the underlying rendering pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>GLSL</strong> – An introduction to the OpenGL Shading Language.</li>
<li><strong>Custom shading</strong> – How to shade geometry using custom shaders.</li>
<li><strong>Shader modifiers</strong> – Inject your shader code at certain points to make modifications.</li>
<li><strong>OpenGL and the render delegate</strong> – Using OpenGL to do completely custom rendering.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter names and content is not final and many smaller topics are covered within these chapters but are not mentioned above.</p>

<p>The book is written by me, <a href="http://ronnqvi.st">David Rönnqvist</a> and will only be available as an iBook from the iBooks Store. I&#8217;m excited over the possibilities with interactive books and having iBooks on OS X Mavericks means that many readers will be able to experience the book right next to their IDE.</p>

<div class="QandA">
<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

<h1>I&#8217;m a iOS developer, is this books not for me?</h1>

<p>SceneKit is not available for iOS but if you want to learn about 3D graphics then I&#8217;m not going to stop you. </p>

<p>Being a Mac developer is a not a prerequisite. In fact, I&#8217;ve done quite a lot of iOS development myself. As long as you are familiar with Objective-C, Foundation and know a little bit about Core Graphics or Core Animation then you should be fine.</p>

<h1>I&#8217;ve never done 3D graphics before, will it be to difficult for me?</h1>

<p>SceneKit is very easy to get started with and I will explain the concepts behind 3D graphics as the book progresses. You don&#8217;t need any 3D experience but it&#8217;s good if you have done some basic graphics programming on either OS X or iOS.</p>

<h1>I have done 3D graphics before, will this be to basic for me?</h1>

<p>Part of SceneKit is the simplicity and part is the integration with other frameworks like AppKit, Core Animation, etc. Even if you&#8217;ve done 3D graphics before, using it together with these frameworks will be new and interesting. You may also note that almost a third of the book covers advanced topics like GLSL and OpenGL. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find something that you like there. </p>

<h1>Will there be maths?</h1>

<p>Yes, a little bit. There is always going to be some maths involved and I will do my best to explain it.</p>

<h1>I&#8217;m convinced. When can I get it?</h1>
