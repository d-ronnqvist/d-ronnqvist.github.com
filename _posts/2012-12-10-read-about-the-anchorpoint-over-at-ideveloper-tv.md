While browsing Stack Overflow over the past few weeks there was many occasions when I wanted to say: “Go read this blog post about the anchorPoint, it will explain things to you.” Luckily I can say that now.

Have a look at the iDeveloper TV blog and read [my post](http://blog.ideveloper.tv/understanding-the-anchor-point/) where I explain most of the mysteries of the `anchorPoint` property on `CALayer`.
